==========

J@ -> J@ is  the framework  invented by using JDollar at year 2015  by Wilmix jemin j.

J@ contains mathematical Statistics. It is the 
one Statistics maths came at year 2015 at Google code.
but that 50% of J@ features given to Oakjava7 programming language.
but another 50% will come after J$ release.
 J$part2 (Jdollar part2) focused for Mathematical statistics and Datascience in year 2015
So Datascience is called as J@Data.
and Machine Learning is called as J@ML in J@ Framework of J$.
So these J@Data,J@ML is the part of JDollar(J$). 
and RAI is used instead of artificial intelligence.  
 and such J@ML, J@Data concept is now removed and updated in oakjava7(Java7.0)â€¦ and 
now only mathematical statistics concept is now found in j@ at JDollarpart2.. 
and AJAVA at J$part2 is focused at year 2017 with DeepLearning Concept..
But due to hackers,competitors, and my financial problem it is hidden.

Please  see the website  at  https://code.google.com/archive/p/jdollarpart2/
for your reference.

So  J@  is divided  in to 4 sections...

J@Data,J@Math, J@ML, J@withJ$part2.

Other things are hidden from hackers and competitors.
